## Usage

Make sure to **always** pin the version of this image to the tag:

```

For testing purposes, you can use the `canary` tag:

```
drevops/ci-runner:canary
```

## Maintenance and releasing

### Versioning

This project uses _Year-Month-Patch_ versioning:

- `YY`: Last two digits of the year, e.g., `23` for 2023.
- `m`: Numeric month, e.g., April is `4`.
- `patch`: Patch number for the month, starting at `0`.

Example: `23.4.2` indicates the third patch in April 2023.

### Releasing

Releases are scheduled to occur at a minimum of once per month.

This image is built by DockerHub via an automated build and tagged as follows:

 - `YY.m.patch` tag - when release tag is published on GitHub.
 - `latest` - when release tag is published on GitHub.
 - `canary` - on every push to `main` branch

### Dependencies update

Renovation bot is used to update dependencies. It creates a PR with the changes
and automatically merges it if CI passes. These changes are then released as
a `canary` version.
